/*BogoSort also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, slow sort, shotgun sort or monkey sort is a particularly ineffective algorithm one person can ever imagine. It is based on generate and test paradigm. The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted.(Wiki) For example, if bogosort is used to sort a deck of cards, it would consist of checking if the deck were in order, and if it were not, one would throw the deck into the air, pick the cards up at random, and repeat the process until the deck is sorted.
Time Complexity: O(?) (since this algorithm has no upper bound)

/*Gnome Sort also called Stupid sort is based on the concept of a Garden Gnome sorting his flower pots. A garden gnome sorts the flower pots by the following method:  
He looks at the flower pot next to him and the previous one; if they are in the right order he steps one pot forward, otherwise he swaps them and steps one pot backwards.
If there is no previous pot (he is at the starting of the pot line), he steps forwards; if there is no pot next to him (he is at the end of the pot line), he is done.
